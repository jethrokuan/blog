#+TITLE: How To Take Smart Notes With Org-mode
#+DATE: <2020-02-14 Fri>
#+HUGO_TAGS: emacs

While writing the documentation for Org-roam, it occurred to me that I
have a lot to say that doesn't truly belong in the documentation. I
wrote Org-roam because Org-mode simply didn't have the utilities to
enable the kind of note-taking workflow I wanted. I don't want to be
prescriptive about how note-taking should be done, but Org-roam is
open enough to enable many note-taking styles, some of which (I feel)
will be inferior to others. This post is also in part for users to
understand that there are several feature requests that I may consider
anti-features, such as renaming notes, having multiple org-roam
directories, and having nested folder structures.

This is the workflow I use. Here I explain what I think note-taking
should be, and why it should be this way. I implore you (especially
users of Org-roam) to read this through. As usual, let me know what
you think by [[mailto:jethrokuan95@gmail.com][mail]].

The ideas here are not my own: much of it comes from How To Take Smart
Notes by Sonke Ahrens.

* Note-taking Is Not Just a Precursor to Writing

#+begin_quote
Notes aren't a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking
process. -- Richard Feynman
#+end_quote

In higher education, students are expected to produce papers. What I
say doesn't just apply to students or aspiring writers: the ability to
turn thoughts to writing is essential for anyone who wants to improve
their learning or writing. One can imagine the process of writing to
be broken down into the following steps:

1. Find topic/research question
2. Research/find literature
3. Read and take notes
4. Draw conclusions / outline text
5. Write

This process seems natural, but it's highly linear, and seems to
suggest that the process of writing begins by first deciding on a
research question. But what about all those lectures and seminars you
attend? Books and papers you read? Conversations with friends,
colleagues, professors? Surely these ideas floating in your head, or
on paper, factor into the written work somehow. Nobody starts from
scratch. How do you know what's a good research question, without
relying on prior reading? How do you know what directions to look in
for new ideas and insights?

Indeed, the preparation for writing begins much earlier, with
note-taking! What if we follow Feynman's advice, and make note-taking
the thinking process?

Suppose you had an awesome second brain, that could surface content up
to you where you wanted it. You have a bunch of unrefined ideas
sitting around, thoughts you had speaking with friends, or from
reading something on the web. Link them up together, and you have a
paper. Instead of beginning with the research question, and going top
down, we begin with the notes, and build and refine ideas from the
bottom up. This also breaks writing down into small, reasonable steps
(one note at a time).

This is the driving principle behind the Zettelkasten method, and it
brings me to my main point:

#+begin_quote
The primary purpose of note-taking should not be for storing ideas,
but for developing them. When we take notes, we should ask: *"In what
context do I want to see this note again?"*
#+end_quote

A corollary is that notes can go anywhere you want, they just have to
surface where you want them to. This is a crucial shift in mindset. We
need to be extremely purposeful with our note-taking. Write down
things that matter, refine them, file them for resurfacing later.

How do we do all these in Org-mode? This is where Org-roam comes in.

* How I Take Notes

I take 2 kinds of notes: fleeting notes, and project-related notes.

Fleeting notes are notes that are taken as a reminder of what's in my
head. I take fleeting notes in my daily notes, an idea borrowed from
[[https://www.roamresearch.com/][Roam Research]]. I couple these fleeting notes with my journal, so I use
[[https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal][org-journal]] to do so:

[[file:images/how_to_take_smart_notes_org/fleeting_notes.gif]]

Fleeting notes get refined into their own note (own file), and are
removed from the daily page. These notes are given file-tags, more on
this later.

** Project Notes

Project notes are basically everything else. Here are some examples of
items that get their own project note:

- a talk (e.g. [[https://braindump.jethro.dev/talks/emacs_should_be_emacs_lisp/][Emacs Should Be Emacs Lisp - Tom Tromey]])
- a book (e.g. [[https://braindump.jethro.dev/books/are_we_smart_enough_to_know_how_smart_animals_are/][Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?]])
- a paper (e.g. [[https://braindump.jethro.dev/papers/dacrema19_progress_neural_rec/][Are We Really Making Much Progress? A Worrying
  Analysis of Recent Neural Reco...]])
- any topic or thought I've refined from my fleeting notes

Let's work through an example. I picked a random link from my to-dos
in my org-agenda: [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22325975][Ask HN: How do you learn complex, dense technical
information? | Hacker News]]

I call =org-roam-find-file=, and type in the title of the note: /"HN :
Learning Complex Technical Information"/:

[[file:images/how_to_take_smart_notes_org/org-roam-find-file.gif]]

(Note the title in the backlinks buffer hasn't updated, because I
had yet to save the file)

This creates a note with a random filename (not important to my
workflow) in the root org-roam folder . Throughout the note-taking
process, I ask myself (I bold again to emphasise): *"In what context
do I want to see this note again?"*

I begin to insert these contextual links to files using
=org-roam-insert=:

[[file:images/how_to_take_smart_notes_org/org-roam-insert-filetag.gif]]

It doesn't matter if the links don't yet exist, Org-roam creates the
files for me. Now if I whenever I want to revisit anything about
learning, I can head to the =Learning= page and look at the back-links
buffer. And it seems I already have material from the [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/][Learning How To
Learn]] course, and [[https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/][an article about how to do hard things]].

[[file:images/how_to_take_smart_notes_org/screenshot2020-02-15_02-02-29_.png]]

Making these kind of manual connections help reinforce learning. Going
through the HN thread, I see various items mentioned, which I link to
in my notes. Again, here I create file links liberally, even though I
may not yet have content in them.

For example, here I:

- see a note of the three-pass technique. I create a new link with
  =org-roam-insert= for =Three Pass Technique=, and add the paper to
  my to-do list (I've already read this, but I should revisit for post
  note-taking me's sake)
- I see some talk on spaced repetition. I already have a note for
  this, which I link to.

Here's what the note ended up looking like. Terrible example (wasn't
really an insightful thread), but I'm in too deep now. This is for
illustrative purposes only. I ended up tossing the note out, and
keeping the linked articles and papers in my org-agenda.

All links are internal links to files within Org-roam. Doing this
continuously builds up a dense network of notes. Some useful file-tags
to have include file-tags from the [[https://praxis.fortelabs.co/the-p-a-r-a-method-a-universal-system-for-organizing-digital-information-75a9da8bfb37/][PARA method]]. Again, it doesn't
matter what file-tags you use, as long as these notes are able to
present themselves when you want them to.

* What Changed?

First, my notes all reside in the same folder, in a flat hierarchy.
Nesting notes /artificially/ introduces a hierarchy, which can be
extremely crippling. I can rely solely on file links to make
connections between notes.

Second, my notes go anywhere they want, and are generally titled based
on their source. This is in contrast with putting a note under a topic
(e.g. "Classical Mechanics"). Notes and ideas can belong to multiple
topics: it's much easier to just tag "topic files" (in my example,
"Learning"). With this, there's no need to think about where a note
should go, and the perpetual question is (I mention yet again) *"In
what context do I want to see this note again?"*, which is much easier
and more meaningful to answer. This also means my notes almost become
write-only. The notes repository can grow incredibly big, and that's
okay. Only the relevant notes surface.

* How to Use These Notes

Nat Eliason produced a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvWic15iXjk][fantastic video showcasing how he used these
notes to outline an article quickly]]. This is showcases essentially
what I discussed earlier about putting together ideas from notes to
produce a written work. If I haven't convinced you that this
note-taking style is extremely empowering, this 15 minute video will.

This article was also written in about an hour, in similar style. I
first looked at all my notes from relevant tags:

- https://braindump.jethro.dev/zettels/writing_with_zettekasten/
- https://braindump.jethro.dev/zettels/how_to_take_smart_notes/
- https://braindump.jethro.dev/zettels/zettelkasten/
- https://braindump.jethro.dev/zettels/roam_research/

And clicked through their links. I simply took a couple of key points
and pieced them together!

* Concluding Remark

All of the above had been enabled by simply exploiting bidirectional
linking to its fullest extent. What I demonstrated only scratches the
surface. There are many amazing Org packages that make note-taking in
Org-mode powerful (see [[https://org-roam.readthedocs.io/en/develop/ecosystem/][Ecosystem - Org-Roam]]), for example the
excellent support for LaTeX, bibtex, tables, to-do, and even literate
programming.

I hope I made it clear that the note-taking technique came first, and
Org-roam was built to enable that. I really encourage you to think
about why you're taking notes, and how you'd like your notes to
serve you. I only recently did this introspection, and have found it
life-changing.
