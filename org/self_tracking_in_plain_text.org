I had recently decided to start doing more self-tracking. In my [[file:org_mode_workflow_preview.org][Org-mode
workflow]] series, I gave a brief overview of how I did task management, but
failed to mention that Org provides clocking capabilities, so I sort-of knew
where I spent my time, and on what. But the stuff I wanted to track are not
related to tasks. For example, I wanted to quickly jot down my mood at different
times of the day, or what I ate. I wanted to also track numeric quantities: how
much water did I drink? How far did I run? How long did I sleep? In short, I
wanted to create log entries for my life, from which I can later do aggregate
analyses on (is my sleep adversely affected by the food I eat?)

I was baffled to find that something simple like this did not quite exist yet.
The habit trackers I could find were either:

1. Too specific: these are apps specifically designed to track a certain action
   (e.g. water intake apps, fitness apps). I needed something that was able to
   track anything.
2. Binary: Org-mode's support for habit-tracking is limited to binary actions
   (e.g. did I exercise today?) Anything more complex [[https://www.philnewton.net/blog/diet-tracking-with-emacs/][required significant
   tooling]]. I needed something where creating log entries was low friction.

This motivated me to build a simple proof-of-concept logger, [[https://github.com/jethrokuan/track][track]]. It also
provided me an avenue to learn Rust, although in hindsight I didn't make much
progress on that front.

* The Track File Syntax

The file produced by track strongly resembles logs you'd see in any software.
it's an append-only file where each line is a log entry, that looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
[2020-10-09T17:54:01.246515233+08:00] water:300ml
#+END_SRC

In square brackets we have the timestamp of the log entry. The log entry begins
with a category, separated from the log entry value by a colon: here it is
=water=. Categories can be arbitrarily complex. For example, for the exercises I
perform, I "group" them under the same category by giving them the categories
=workout:push-ups= and =workout:pull-ups=.

The log entry value can take on two forms. First, if the value begins
with a digit, track assumes that we wish to log a numerical quantity. In the
above example, the log entry has a quantity of =300=, with units =ml=.

The log entry could also be free-form text. This is for logging other random
things, like mood. An example of such a log entry would be:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
[2020-10-09T14:52:46.884145110+08:00] mood:good
#+END_SRC

track exposes a simple command-line interface to create log entries via =track
add=, which takes two indexed arguments, the category, and the entry value.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
track add water 300ml
#+END_SRC

* Querying the Log

=track= exposes a query interface of the form =track query category num-days=,
where =num-days= defaults to 7 (the past week). It currently performs a simple
task:

1. It filters for entries that are at most =num-days= back, and whose category
   contains =category=.
2. Numerical quantities are summed together when the units match. For example,
   if there were two entries on the same day, one for =water:300ml= and the
   other =water:600ml=, track would report =water:900ml=.

This is what I see running =track query water= on my 5 days of log entries.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
~ on  master [!] 
❯ track query water 7

05 Oct 2020  water      1400ml                        
06 Oct 2020  water      1600ml                        
07 Oct 2020  water      1900ml                        
08 Oct 2020  water      2000ml                        
09 Oct 2020  water      1700ml   
#+END_SRC

* Entering Entries on the Go

Because the log format is so simple, I shipped ~track~ with a simple Telegram
bot, that allowed me to add entries by sending the bot an entry:

[[file:images/self_tracking/telegram.png]]

I host the Telegram bot on my DigitalOcean instance, and run ~sshfs~ so that
all my writes go the remote track file as well.

* Closing Thoughts

Right now I have only been tracking for a short while, so I cannot yet comment
whether it will be useful, but this certainly reduces the friction. I'm hoping
to hook some things up so that automatic entries are created (e.g. amount of
sleep, from my Xiaomi Miband).
