Since I've been writing on the topic of workflows and tooling, I
thought I'd give one of my favourite packages, [Guild AI](https://guild.ai/), a shout-out,
and well-deserved exposure.

Guild AI is designed for managing machine learning experiments. It provides ways
to track experiment runs, make runs reproducible, and compare runs with
different hyperparameters, all in ways that are non-intrusive. Those who know me
know I care a lot about my tools, and this is one of those tools that really
spark joy. It's no surprise that the author of this package, [Garrett Smith](https://github.com/gar1t),
comes from a systems engineering background. Garrett is also highly responsive
on Slack and the community site [my.guild.ai](https://my.guild.ai/), actively listening to the users,
and provides support.


## The Competition {#the-competition}

While there is [no shortage of machine learning tooling](https://medium.com/@hadyelsahar/how-do-you-manage-your-machine-learning-experiments-ab87508348ac), Guild AI takes
a minimal and un-intrusive approach towards instrumenting the training
scripts. Take [Sacred](https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred/) for example. It requires instrumenting the Python
training script with decorators:

```python

  from sacred import Experiment
  ex = Experiment('iris_rbf_svm')

  @ex.config
  def cfg():
    C = 1.0
    gamma = 0.7

  @ex.automain
  def run(C, gamma):
    iris = datasets.load_iris()
    # ...
```

Scalar logging for Sacred is also a custom module within Sacred, and
visualizing these scalars is done through custom frontends like
Omniboard.

Guild AI cleanly uses default Python functionality, allowing one to
get started without any modification to training scripts. This also
makes Guild a nice, non-committal choice. I use command-line
arguments from `argparse` as configuration flags. Guild AI also has
first-class support for TensorBoard, which is a popular and powerful
choice.


## Experiment Tracking with Guild AI {#experiment-tracking-with-guild-ai}

Each run of the training script is tracked, by running them through
the intuitive guild CLI. The run processes are tracked by Guild.

Guild even ships with a beautiful web interface that allows you to
view run files (model checkpoints, logs etc.), accessible via `guild view`.


## Comparing Runs {#comparing-runs}

I use `guild tensorboard -C` to load TensorBoard for all my completed
runs (`-C`).

```bash
  jethro@server1-CLeAR: ~/projects/snnrl$ guild tensorboard -C
  Preparing runs for TensorBoard
  TensorBoard 2.1.0 at http://server1-CLeAR:52675 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

It even supports the TensorFlow HParam view, which is designed for
comparing runs with differing hyperparameters.

Guild AI supports a SQL-like filtering interface to allow the user to
choose which runs to load and compare.


## Hyperparameter Search {#hyperparameter-search}

Guild AI supports multiple methods for hyperparameter search:

1.  Grid search
2.  Random search
3.  Bayesian Optimization

This can be specified easily via the CLI:

```bash
  guild run train.py x=[-0.5,-0.4,-0.3,-0.2,-0.1]
```

Hyperparameter search and reproducibility is especially important in
Reinforcement Learning, and Guild has made this extremely simple.


## Deployment {#deployment}

Since I'm using Guild AI within a research project, I'm not using
these features. But Guild AI supports [packaging](https://my.guild.ai/docs/packages/), allowing for model
collaboration, sharing and reuse.


## Conclusion {#conclusion}

I'm pleased with Guild AI as is, and the author is actively working on
bringing improvements to the tool. I highly recommend machine learning
practitioners to give it a whirl.
